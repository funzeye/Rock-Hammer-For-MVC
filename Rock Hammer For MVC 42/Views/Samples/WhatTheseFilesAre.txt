These are like the hammer for mac versions of mvc partial views. 
Where possible, I have created corresponding mvc partials in the Partials folder.
Add your own partial pages when you need to use some code from this set of Samples.
Follow the implementation of the files in the Partials folder, noting how they are called in Layout.cshtml

_scripts.html has been made into _scripts.cshtml BUT ALSO a bundle in BundleConfig.cs
The default implementation of Layout.cshtml uses the bundleconfig version of scripts.html
