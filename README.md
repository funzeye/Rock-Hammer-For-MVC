Rock-Hammer-For-MVC
===================

Visual Studio template for MVC 4 project that includes customized Rock Hammer responsive template.

This is a Project Template that implements a C# ASP.NET MVC 4 version of the popular Responsive Framework 'Rock Hammer'.

Rock Hammer is designed by default to be used with 'Hammer For Mac'. This template, however, is a customized implementation which allows users to use this framework in Visual Studio 2012 with .Net 4.5.

This version (1.3.3) is based on the latest Rock Hammer GitHub release as of 26-Sept-2013. For detailed instructions on how to use Rock Hammer view http://malarkey.github.io/Rock-Hammer/

It is recommended that users install the VS extension [Mindscape Web Workbench](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2b96d16a-c986-4501-8f97-8008f9db141a) to work with the SCSS files.

This template uses the standard 'Basic' MVC 4 template as a base with the Rock Hammer project library files added to it with some minor alterations.

##Installation Options

1. [Install this Visual Studio Extension (.vsix)](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/03e3117d-490b-4711-a2a1-cb36f5adc73e)
2. Create a new project in Visual Studio
3. Select the Rock Hammer For MVC 4 Project Template from the C# templates

4. Recommend doing a "Nuget Package Restore" and/or doing a Build to restore any missing references. Nuget and Project Templates don't seem to get along!
